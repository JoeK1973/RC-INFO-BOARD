# RC-INFO-BOARD
A wireless race timing display and gantry lights system for RC model car racing.

The project has three main parts:

1) A transmitter module that takes in timing and start/finish light information from the race timing software and sends it via a high-power nRF24L01 transceiver.

2) A receiver module that receives the information from the transmitter and displays the timing information. This part of the project will have several implementations in relation to the size of the timing display and the type of hardware chosen for the display in relation to the size.

3) A receiver module that receives the information from the transmitter and displays the start/finish lighting sequences. This part of the project will probably only have a single implementation.
